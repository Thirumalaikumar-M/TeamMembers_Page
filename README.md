## Integration with RandomUser API

To streamline the process of adding and managing team members, the page leverages the power of the RandomUser API. By utilizing the RandomUser API, you can dynamically fetch and display random user data for each team member. This eliminates the need for manual entry and allows for quick updates whenever necessary.

The API provides multiple data such as name, gender, location, email, dob and etc,.. I have fetched only selected data - random profile pictures, names, email addresses, and addresses, enhancing the authenticity of the team member profiles.

The usage of the RandomUser API not only simplifies data management but also adds a touch of dynamism to your Team Members Page, making it more engaging and interactive for visitors.
